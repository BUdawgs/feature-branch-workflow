# Thinkful: Collaboration with GitHub

- On the main branch, run git pull so that you have the most up-to-date version.

- Create a new feature branch from the main branch.

- Create new commits on your new branch.

- Push your new branch up to GitHub.

- Create a pull request and have it reviewed.

After making any requested changes, merge the pull request, bringing the new commits into the main branch.
